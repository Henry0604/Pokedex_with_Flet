# Pokedex with Flet
This project makes use of the Python language and the multiplatform framework called Flet to create a Pokedex where the image of the Pokemon and its data are shown, it also makes use of the API known as "PokeAPI" to extract the information of each Pokemon and display it.

## Introduction
This app created with Flet and Python has the function to simulate a Pokedex which gives information to the users of the Pokemon from 1 to 150, being able to observe how they are through an image to later see the corresponding information.
